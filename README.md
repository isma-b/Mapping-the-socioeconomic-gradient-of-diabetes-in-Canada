Diabetes Gradient in Canada





This project analyzes the prevalence of diabetes across Canadian provinces using official data from Statistics Canada (Table 13-10-0096-01). The goal is to map and understand the socioeconomic gradient of diabetes, showing how health outcomes vary regionally.

Overview
The notebook performs:
1. Loading and cleaning of Statistics Canada data
2. Filtering for diabetes prevalence indicators
3. Statistical summary of provincial rates
4. Geographic mapping of diabetes prevalence using a choropleth map
5. Discussion of regional health disparities

Key Findings
Diabetes prevalence varies noticeably across provinces.
Higher prevalence tends to align with regions facing socioeconomic challenges.
Highlights the importance of addressing structural health inequalities in Canada.
